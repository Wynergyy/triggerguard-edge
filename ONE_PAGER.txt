TriggerGuard is a deterministic request control component designed to operate at the network edge.

It provides predictable enforcement of request behaviour before application logic is reached, reducing risk and uncertainty at exposed ingress points.

TriggerGuard is built for environments where latency, trust boundaries, and operational pressure demand clarity rather than adaptive or opaque security mechanisms.

The product enables operators to define and enforce explicit behavioural constraints, ensuring that only conforming requests are allowed to progress into core systems.

TriggerGuard is suitable for use in distributed platforms, exposed APIs, edge compute environments, and high-pressure network entry points.

It is developed and maintained by Wynergy Fibre Solutions Ltd as part of its core platform architecture.
