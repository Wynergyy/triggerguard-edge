TriggerGuard is designed to sit at the earliest practical ingress point in a system, before application logic and business processing.

It operates as a deterministic control layer that evaluates inbound request behaviour against explicit constraints and rules.

TriggerGuard does not inspect application state, user data, or business logic. Its responsibility is limited to classifying and enforcing request behaviour at the boundary.

The component is intended to run at the edge or gateway layer, where latency sensitivity and blast-radius containment are critical concerns.

Decisions are explicit and auditable. Requests are either permitted to continue or constrained according to defined behaviour rules. There is no adaptive learning or opaque decision-making.

TriggerGuard is designed to integrate cleanly with existing platforms without coupling to internal services or frameworks.

This architecture ensures predictable behaviour, clear failure modes, and minimal operational overhead.
