Subject: Re: Deterministic request control at the edge

Hello,

I wanted to briefly follow up on my previous message regarding TriggerGuard.

TriggerGuard is a deterministic edge control component designed to provide predictable enforcement of request behaviour before application logic is reached.

If this is not currently a priority, no problem at all. If it is relevant, I would be happy to provide a short technical overview or discuss potential deployment scenarios.

Kind regards,
