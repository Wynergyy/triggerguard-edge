TriggerGuard is licensed on a commercial basis according to deployment context and operational scale.

Pricing is intentionally simple and conversation-led rather than tier-heavy or feature-gated.

Typical engagement models include:

• Proof-of-concept or evaluation licence  
• Single-environment production deployment  
• Multi-environment or platform-wide deployment  

Pricing is determined by factors such as deployment scope, traffic characteristics, and operational requirements.

TriggerGuard is positioned as an infrastructure control component rather than a per-user or per-seat product.

All commercial terms are provided directly by Wynergy Fibre Solutions Ltd.
