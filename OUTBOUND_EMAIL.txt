Subject: Deterministic request control at the edge

Hello,

I am reaching out to introduce TriggerGuard, a deterministic request control component designed to operate at the network edge.

TriggerGuard enforces explicit behavioural constraints on inbound requests before application logic is reached, providing predictable control in environments where trust boundaries, latency, and operational pressure are critical.

It is designed for platforms that require clarity and auditability rather than adaptive or opaque security mechanisms.

If this aligns with challenges you are currently facing, I would be happy to provide a short technical overview or discuss potential use cases.

Kind regards,
