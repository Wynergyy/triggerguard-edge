1. LICENCE TERM

All TriggerGuard licences are issued for a fixed, time-limited term.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing:
• Standard Pilot licences are valid for 30 days
• Sentinel+ licences are valid for 30 days during pilot phase

The licence expiry timestamp is embedded in the licence payload and enforced at runtime.

Licences do not auto-renew.

---

2. RENEWAL PROCESS

Licence renewal requires:
• A new payment reference or approved contract reference
• Issuance of a new licence identifier
• A new cryptographic integrity hash

Renewals are treated as new licence issuances.

Previous licences expire automatically and cannot be extended or reactivated.

---

3. EXPIRY BEHAVIOUR

On expiry:
• Runtime enforcement MUST reject the licence
• The licence status is considered TERMINATED
• No grace period is assumed unless explicitly granted in writing

Expired licences cannot be used for production workloads.

---

4. NO PERPETUAL LICENCES

TriggerGuard licences are not perpetual.

No licence grants lifetime access, indefinite use, or unlimited duration.

All access is conditional on an active, time-bounded licence.

---

5. UPGRADE PATHS

Licence tiers are discrete.

Upgrading from Pilot to Sentinel+ requires:
• A new licence issuance
• A new tier designation
• A new integrity hash

Tier upgrades do not modify or extend existing licences.

---

6. AUDIT AND VERIFICATION

Licence validity may be verified by:
• Timestamp inspection
• Integrity hash validation
• Issuer confirmation

Wynergy Fibre Solutions Ltd reserves the right to revoke licences issued in error or obtained fraudulently.

---

7. POLICY CHANGES

This policy may be updated between versions.

Policy changes do not retroactively modify already-issued licences unless required by law.
