Effective Date:
14 December 2025


1. PURPOSE

This policy defines the conditions under which a TriggerGuard licence may be
suspended, revoked, or allowed to expire, and how enforcement is applied at
runtime.

TriggerGuard is a deterministic control system. Licensing enforcement is
explicit, predictable, and non-discretionary.


2. LICENCE STATES

A TriggerGuard licence may exist in one of the following states:

- ACTIVE
- SUSPENDED
- REVOKED
- EXPIRED

State transitions are irreversible except where explicitly stated.


3. SUSPENSION CONDITIONS

A licence may be SUSPENDED under the following conditions:

- Payment dispute or chargeback under investigation
- Temporary breach of usage limits
- Administrative review requested by the licensee
- Pending renewal beyond the grace period

During suspension:
- Runtime enforcement remains active
- Requests are denied with a deterministic licence error
- No data is modified or destroyed

Suspension may be lifted at the issuer’s discretion following resolution.


4. REVOCATION CONDITIONS

A licence will be REVOKED if any of the following occur:

- Confirmed non-payment or fraudulent payment reference
- Licence key sharing or unauthorised redistribution
- Circumvention or tampering with TriggerGuard enforcement
- Use of TriggerGuard in violation of applicable law
- Material breach of licence terms

Revocation is permanent.

Once revoked:
- The licence cannot be reinstated
- A new licence requires a new commercial agreement


5. EXPIRY AND NON-RENEWAL

Licences expire automatically at the stated expiry timestamp.

If renewal payment is not received:
- Licence enters EXPIRED state
- Runtime enforcement denies all requests
- No grace period applies unless contractually agreed

Expired licences are not considered revoked.


6. RUNTIME ENFORCEMENT BEHAVIOUR

At runtime, TriggerGuard MUST:

- Verify licence integrity hash
- Verify licence state
- Verify current timestamp against expiry

Behaviour by state:

ACTIVE:
- Normal operation

SUSPENDED:
- Deterministic deny with suspension reason

REVOKED:
- Deterministic deny with revocation code
- No retries permitted

EXPIRED:
- Deterministic deny with renewal instruction


7. AUDIT AND EVIDENCE

All licence state changes MUST be:

- Logged deterministically
- Persisted in the authoritative licence ledger
- Hash-linked to the previous state

These records form part of the TriggerGuard audit trail.


8. APPEALS AND REVIEW

Revocation decisions are final unless:
- A demonstrable issuer error occurred, or
- A court or regulator requires review

Support enquiries may be submitted to:
licensing@wfsl.uk


9. GOVERNANCE

This policy is part of the TriggerGuard licensing framework and is enforced
programmatically.

Manual overrides are not permitted except by company directors.
