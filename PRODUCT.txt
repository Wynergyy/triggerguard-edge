TriggerGuard is a deterministic request control component designed to operate at the network edge.

It enforces behavioural constraints on inbound requests before application logic is reached, providing predictable control in environments where trust, latency, and system pressure are critical factors.

TriggerGuard is not a firewall, proxy, or analytics tool. It is a pre-logic guardrail that ensures only validated and conforming request behaviour is allowed to progress further into a system.

The product is designed for operators who require clarity, auditability, and deterministic failure modes rather than opaque heuristics or adaptive guesswork.

Typical deployment scenarios include high-pressure ingress points, exposed APIs, distributed edge platforms, and environments where upstream systems must be protected from malformed, abusive, or unexpected traffic patterns.

TriggerGuard is developed and maintained by Wynergy Fibre Solutions Ltd as part of its core platform architecture.
